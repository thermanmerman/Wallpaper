# Wallpaper

I wanted to create a custom wallpaper on my computer background instead of the classic green hills and blue skies. Using software called Wallpaper Engine, which allows you to make just about any kind of file you want your background, including .exe files, I decided to make a wallpaper that includes the following features:

-A "Spawn Object" button that allows the user to spawn a random shape that falls

-A platform that moves back and forth, which can be used to stack the objects

-A live time tracker

-The ability to draw or write whatever you want. The drawings also have colliders so you can catch the shapes to make an infinite number of images.

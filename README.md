# wallpaper

I was getting bored of the typical pictures of green hills and blue skys on my computer background and I wanted something a bit more custom. I have this software called wallpaper engine which allows you to make just about any kind of file you want your background, including .exe files. This gave me the idea to make one in unity. The project includes: 

  -A "Spawn Object" button that allows the user to instantiate a random shape that falls
  
  -A little platform that moves back and forth that can be used to stack the objects
  
  -A live time tracker
  
  -The ability to draw or write whatever your heart desires
    -The drawings also have colliders so you can catch the shapes to make an infinite amount of funny looking images
